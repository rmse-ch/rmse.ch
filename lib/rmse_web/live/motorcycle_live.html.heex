          A long, long time ago... in 2016, cars became more and more automated. And while this
          in general should help - for me it was not helpful at all. I was just
          more and more bored during drives and also not enjoying the
          car driving anymore. So I did what everyone should do in this situation:
          I sold my car.
        </p>

        <p>
          What may be not everyone should or will do: next I walked into a shop of
          motorcycles (<.link

          and asked what I need to get started. I got an explanation and within short time I was sitting on this two tires.
          Since then I never looked back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whenever I find free time and the weather isn't deep winter or storm, I will
          take out the motorcycle and go out driving.

          My starting point. It was a good bike for someone as me, who starts
          at that late in a stage and it served me well for around 1/2 year, before
          it decided that it prefers a small mountain river more than me and threw me off.

          My follow up. Shortly after the crash mentioned above I had an exam so I needed something new. Luckily
          I got this motorcycle which I drove for quite some time.

          My current love. The best motorcycle I had until now and I love driving around on it.
          Feels like endless power while also just being comfortable for using.
